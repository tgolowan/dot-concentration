   - Choose your repository

3. **Configure Deployment**
   - Railway will automatically detect the Node.js app
   - The `package.json` and `server.js` files will be used
   - No additional configuration needed

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait for the build to complete
   - Your app will be available at the provided Railway URL

### 3. Custom Domain (Optional)

## Environment Variables
No environment variables are required for this app to run.

## Health Check
The app includes a health check endpoint at `/health` that Railway will use to monitor the service.

## File Structure
```
focus-dot-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main HTML file
â”œâ”€â”€ style.css           # CSS styles and animations
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js           # JavaScript functionality
â”œâ”€â”€ server.js           # Express server
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json        # Node.js dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ railway.json        # Railway configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore          # Git ignore file
â””â”€â”€ README.md           # App documentation
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
- Ensure all files are committed to git
- Check that `package.json` has correct dependencies
- Verify Node.js version compatibility

### Runtime Issues
- Check Railway logs in the dashboard
- Ensure the app starts on the correct port (Railway provides PORT env var)
- Verify all static files are being served correctly

### Performance
- The app is lightweight and should run smoothly on Railway's free tier
- No database or external services required

## Monitoring
- Use Railway's built-in monitoring dashboard
- Check logs for any errors
- Monitor the health check endpoint

Your Focus Dot App should now be live and accessible from anywhere! ðŸš€
